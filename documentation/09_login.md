## Login to Mastermind

**Intro**

This will go over how to ssh into the Mastermind, if you are connected via monitor see the instructions [here](https://github.com/rpng/firefly/blob/master/documentation/05_monitor_connection.md).

It is highly recommended that the Mastermind be configured to a static IP address on the network so that this connection can be setup once.

1. Power on the Mastermind and wait for up to a minute for the start up to complete
2. Using [Putty](http://www.putty.org/) on Windows or bash on Linux connect to the IP that you assigned to the Mastermind. Example in bash `ssh 192.168.1.3` The default port 22 is used if not specified.
3. Once connected login to the Mastermind as you normally would using the asctec user.
